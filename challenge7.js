// Challenge 7
// Make a NEW array with 5 values of your choice, using the same syntax as the array creation from the previous 6 challenges; that is, every value should be placed within the square brackets.  Now console.log out each value individually.

const arr = [1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000];

for (value of arr) {
    console.log(value);
}
